# When to Use What - Superpower-ECC

This guide helps you choose the right tool for the job in Superpower-ECC (an integration of Superpowers by Jesse Vincent and Everything Claude Code by Affaan Mustafa).

## Three-Layer Architecture

Superpower-ECC integrates three complementary layers:

### Layer 1: Superpowers Systematic Workflows

## Decision Trees

### Planning a Feature

```
Do you have a clear specification?
├─ NO → Use superpowers:brainstorming
│       Then: superpowers:writing-plans
│
└─ YES → Do you want guided ADR creation?
          ├─ YES → Use superpowers:writing-plans
          │
          └─ NO → Do you want autonomous planning?
                  ├─ YES → Use planner agent
                  │
                  └─ NO → Use /ecc:plan command
```

**Examples:**
- **New feature, unclear requirements:** `superpowers:brainstorming` → `superpowers:writing-plans`
- **Clear spec, want ADR:** `superpowers:writing-plans`
- **Clear spec, want quick plan:** `/ecc:plan`
- **Let AI handle it:** `planner` agent

### Testing Your Code

```
What testing approach do you need?
├─ Full TDD workflow → superpowers:test-driven-development
│
├─ Check coverage gaps → /ecc:test-coverage
│
├─ Generate E2E tests → /ecc:e2e
│
├─ Autonomous TDD guidance → tdd-guide agent
│
└─ Run tests → /ecc:go-test or /ecc:python-test
```

**Examples:**
- **Starting new feature with TDD:** `superpowers:test-driven-development`
- **Existing code needs tests:** `/ecc:test-coverage` to identify gaps
- **Need integration tests:** `/ecc:e2e` to generate scenarios
- **Want TDD coaching:** `tdd-guide` agent
- **Just run the tests:** `/ecc:go-test` or `/ecc:python-test`

### Code Review

```
What stage is your code at?
├─ Ready for human review → superpowers:requesting-code-review
│   (automatically invokes code-reviewer and security-reviewer agents)
│
├─ Want quick spot check → /ecc:code-review
│
├─ Security-specific review → security-reviewer agent
│
└─ Autonomous full review → code-reviewer agent
```

**Examples:**
- **Preparing PR for team:** `superpowers:requesting-code-review`
- **Quick self-check during development:** `/ecc:code-review`
- **Security-focused review:** `security-reviewer` agent
- **Autonomous pre-commit review:** `code-reviewer` agent

### Fixing Build Errors

```
How complex is the build error?

│   (pattern-matching for known issues)
│
├─ Complex/unclear error → superpowers:systematic-debugging
│   (full diagnostic workflow)
│
└─ Language-specific → /ecc:go-build (Go projects)
```

**Examples:**
- **"Cannot find symbol" in Go:** `/ecc:go-build` or `/ecc:build-fix`
- **Weird interaction between components:** `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- **Quick fix attempt:** `/ecc:build-fix`

### Refactoring Code

```
What's the scope of refactoring?
├─ Major refactoring (architecture changes)
│   → superpowers:brainstorming → superpowers:writing-plans
│   → Implement with superpowers:test-driven-development
│
├─ Remove dead code → /ecc:refactor-clean
│
└─ Code quality improvements → /ecc:code-review first
    Then: Manual refactoring
    Then: /ecc:test-coverage to verify
```

**Examples:**
- **Restructuring module architecture:** Use full workflow (brainstorm → plan → TDD)
- **Cleaning up unused functions:** `/ecc:refactor-clean`
- **Improving code quality:** `/ecc:code-review` → refactor → `/ecc:test-coverage`

### Learning and Pattern Extraction

```
When do you want to extract patterns?
├─ Automatically when finishing → superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
│   (calls superpowers:extract-patterns automatically)
│
├─ Manually anytime → /ecc:learn
│
├─ Check learned patterns → /ecc:instinct-status
│
├─ Export patterns → /ecc:instinct-export
│
└─ Import patterns → /ecc:instinct-import
```

**Examples:**
- **Finishing a feature branch:** `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` (auto-extracts)
- **Just learned something useful:** `/ecc:learn` to capture it
- **See what patterns exist:** `/ecc:instinct-status`
- **Share patterns with team:** `/ecc:instinct-export`
- **Use team patterns:** `/ecc:instinct-import`

### Multi-Step Workflows

```
Need to coordinate multiple operations?
├─ Frontend + Backend changes → /ecc:multi-frontend and /ecc:multi-backend
│
├─ Execute across services → /ecc:multi-execute
│
├─ Complex orchestration → /ecc:multi-workflow
│
└─ Full planning across services → /ecc:multi-plan
```

**Examples:**
- **API change affecting frontend:** `/ecc:multi-backend` then `/ecc:multi-frontend`
- **Update all microservices:** `/ecc:multi-execute`
- **Coordinate complex release:** `/ecc:multi-workflow`

## When You're a Beginner vs Expert

### If You're New to the Codebase

**Recommended approach:** Use Layer 1 (Systematic Workflows)

**Why:**
- Guidance through each step
- Context and explanation provided
- Validation at checkpoints
- Learning built into the process

**Start with:**
1. `superpowers:brainstorming` - Understand the problem space
2. `superpowers:writing-plans` - Create structured plan with ADRs
3. `superpowers:test-driven-development` - Implement with TDD
4. `superpowers:requesting-code-review` - Prepare for review
5. `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` - Complete and learn

**Benefits:**
- Builds understanding of the codebase
- Captures decisions in ADRs
- Extracts patterns for future reference
- Reduces mistakes through validation

### If You're an Experienced Developer

**Recommended approach:** Use Layer 3 (Quick Tools) + Layer 2 (Auto-enhancements)

**Why:**
- Direct access to specific functionality
- No overhead of guided steps
- Compose tools for custom workflows
- Still get automatic enhancements

**Common workflows:**
1. `/ecc:plan` - Quick planning
2. `/ecc:test-coverage` - Check test gaps
3. Implement code
4. `/ecc:code-review` - Quick check
5. `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` - Extract patterns

**Or fully autonomous:**
1. `planner` agent - Let AI plan
2. Implement with `tdd-guide` agent support
3. `code-reviewer` agent - Automated review
4. `/ecc:learn` - Manual pattern extraction

**Benefits:**
- Faster execution
- Less interruption
- Still capture learnings
- Flexibility to compose tools

### If You're on a Team

**Recommended approach:** Mix both layers based on task complexity

**For complex features:**
- Use Layer 1 for planning and design (captures ADRs for team)
- Use Layer 3 for implementation (faster iteration)
- Use Layer 1 for finishing (extracts patterns for team)

**For maintenance tasks:**
- Use Layer 3 exclusively (quick fixes)
- Use `/ecc:learn` to share insights

**For knowledge sharing:**
- Use `/ecc:instinct-export` to share patterns
- Use `/ecc:instinct-import` to load team patterns
- Use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to ensure patterns are captured

**Benefits:**
- Team alignment through ADRs
- Shared pattern library
- Flexibility for individual work styles
- Consistent code review process

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Systematic, Then Accelerate

- Use Layer 1 (workflows) when learning
- Graduate to Layer 3 (quick tools) when proficient
- Always use Layer 1 for finishing branches (pattern extraction)

### 2. Let Auto-Enhancements Work for You

- Don't manually invoke `code-reviewer` agent if using `superpowers:requesting-code-review`
- Let workflows handle the orchestration
- Trust the automatic pattern extraction

### 3. Compose Quick Tools

Quick tools are designed to work together:
```
/ecc:plan → implement → /ecc:test-coverage → /ecc:code-review → /ecc:learn
```

### 4. Use Behavior Modes Strategically

- `superpowers:pairing-mode` - When you want conversational guidance
- `superpowers:focused-mode` - When you want minimal interruption
- `superpowers:learning-mode` - When you want maximum explanation

### 5. Capture Knowledge Continuously

- Use `/ecc:learn` whenever you solve something non-obvious
- Use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to capture comprehensive patterns
- Use `/ecc:instinct-export` to share with team regularly

### 6. Match Tool to Task Complexity

| Task Complexity | Recommended Layer |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Simple fix | Layer 3 (Quick tool) |
| Medium feature | Layer 3 + Layer 2 (Quick + Auto) |
| Complex feature | Layer 1 (Systematic workflow) |
| Learning phase | Layer 1 (Systematic workflow) |
| Teaching others | Layer 1 (Systematic workflow) |

### When in Doubt

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Do I need guidance?** → Use Layer 1 (Systematic Workflow)
2. **Do I know exactly what I need?** → Use Layer 3 (Quick Tool)
3. **Do I want AI to handle it?** → Use Layer 3 (Agent)
4. **Is this complex and important?** → Use Layer 1 (Systematic Workflow)
5. **Am I finishing work?** → Use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`

**Default recommendation:**
- When learning: Always start with Layer 1
- When proficient: Use Layer 3 for speed, Layer 1 for finishing
- When teaching: Always use Layer 1
- When in doubt: Use Layer 1
